<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Floralis aims to make any type of dye farmable by adding different kinds of farmables to the game. Furthermore it aims to do that in an automatable way with the help of third party mods, for example with a Multi Farm from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forestry">Forestry</a>, Garden Cloches from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering">Immersive Engineering</a>, Plant Sower and Gatherer from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-foregoing">Industrial Foregoing</a> and the Phytogenic Insulator from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>. Every dye added by this mod should be compatible with every mod that requests some sort of dye in their crafting recipes.<br /></span></span><br /><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/logo-recolor.png" width="352" height="54" /></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">As soon as you travel around your world, you'll either find a new type of flower, or in the case you're wandering through a dessert, a new type of cactus. Look around for a while and you'll see that there is one type of flower and one type of cactus for each dye. You'll find them every few chunks in small groups sorted by their color. Flowers or cacti of the same color but with different hues like blue and grey spawn together in one group. Besides from looking pretty, they serve a useful purpose. Upon breaking one of either those flowers or cacti, they'll drop you two respective seeds and one petal, each in their respective color.</span><br /><br /><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/plant-drops.gif" alt="" width="704" height="352" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">If you're lucky enough, you'll find a village with up to three custom fields for flowers and cacti each, packed with different color types. A farmer will offer you some trades to either get emeralds for flower and cactus seeds or to get petals or dye for emeralds. Of course there's a trade for each type of color.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/villager-trading.gif" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The seeds you just got are pretty straight forward to use, either loosen some dirt with a hoe for flower seeds to be plantable or plant cactus seeds on some sand. Give them some time to grow to their full size or just dump some bonemeal over them. You wont get more than one seed and not even a single petal if you harvest them before they've reached their final stage. You can tell that they've reached their final stage by their fully blooming blossom. Just as the natural spawning flowers and cacti, the farmable ones also drop two respective seeds and one petal of their respective color.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/crop-drops.gif" alt="" width="704" height="352" /></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">To finally get the dye, just place the petals in any type of furnace to dry them. The result will be some dye of the respective petal color. You can use this dye just as any regular dye, color some wool or glass, even sheeps.</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br /><br /></span></span></span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/dye-drying.gif" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">You can even store the dye in blocks, just in case you got too much of it, and they're decorative as well.</span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br /><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/block-crafting.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">And of course you can get your dye back out of those chunky blocks to keep coloring some sheeps.</span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br /><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/dye-crafting.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
