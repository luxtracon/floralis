<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Floralis aims to make any type of dye farmable by adding farmable cacti and flowers to the game. Furthemore it aims to do that in an automatable way with the help of third party mods. For example with a Multi Farm from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forestry">Forestry</a>, Garden Cloche from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering">Immersive Engineering</a>, Plant Sower and Plant Gatherer from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-foregoing">Industrial Foregoing</a> and Phytogenic Insulator from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">As soon as you travel around your world, you'll either find a new type of cactus or a new type of flower, depending on the biome you wander through. Cactus plants can be found in any desert type biome, while flower plants can be found in any other biome but not in desert type biomes. When you look around for a while, you'll see that there is one type of cactus and one type of flower for each type of dye. You'll find them every few chunks in small groups sorted by their color. But take care, the cacti might sting! Besides from looking pretty and attracting bees, they serve another useful purpose. Upon breaking one of either a cactus or flower, they'll drop two respective seeds depending on their plant type and color, one plant petal in their respective color and one plant fiber. Harvesting them with a pair of shears or a silk touch enchanted tool will drop the cactus or flower itself instead, for you to plant or pot it as decoration.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">If you're lucky enough, you'll find a village with one or more custom fields of either cacti or flowers, again depending on the biome the village is generated in. A field packed with cacti will only generate in desert type villages, while a field packed with flowers will only generate in any other biome but not in desert type biomes. A farmer villager near the field will offer you some trades to either get emeralds for seeds or to get plant petals for emeralds. The type of seeds the farmer villager will trade with you is again depending on the village type. Cactus seeds can only be obtained by farmer villager in desert type villages, while flower seeds can be obtained by farmer villager in any other village type but not in desert type villages.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The seeds you just have gotten are pretty straight forward to use, either plant cactus seeds on some sand or plant flower seeds on farmland. Give them time to grow to their full size, which will be indicated by the fully blooming blossom on top of the crop. You wont get back more than the one seed you used to plant the crop as long as they aren't fully grown. When fully grown, they'll drop two respective seeds depending on their plant type and color, one plant petal in their respective color and one plant fiber, just like their natural spawning counterparts.&nbsp;Harvesting them with a pair of shears or a silk touch enchanted tool will drop the cactus or flower itself instead, for you to plant or pot it as decoration. As long as a cactus crop isn't old enough to develop its thorns, it wont hurt you or any other entity.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">To finally get the dye, just dry the petals in a furnace. The petals will be dried to their respectively colored dye counterpart.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">In case you stock up too much dye, you can store it in compact storage blocks, one for each type of dye.</span></span></p>
<p><br /><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/crafting_compress_dye_block.gif" alt="" width="352" height="332" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course you can reverse this progress to get the dye back out of their respective storage blocks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plant fibers can be used just like bone meal, to speed up the growth of crops, sow some grass and flowers, or use it as a fertilizer with third party mods. Just like with dye, there is a storage block in case you've piled up to much plant fibers.</p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br />The provided config file will let you adjust the way the mod generates its features. You can You can enable and disable independently whether cacti and flowers should get generated naturally, as well as enable and disbale whether cacti and flower fields should get generated in villages. You can enable and disable village field generation independently per village type. You can also adjust the rarity and density in which natural generating cacti and flowers occur.</span></p>
