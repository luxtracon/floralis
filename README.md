<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Floralis aims to make any type of dye farmable by adding different kinds of farmable plants to the game. Furthermore it aims to do that in an automatable way with the help of third party mods, for example with a Multi Farm from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/forestry">Forestry</a>, Garden Cloches from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering">Immersive Engineering</a>, Plant Sower and Gatherer from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/industrial-foregoing">Industrial Foregoing</a> and the Phytogenic Insulator from <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion">Thermal Expansion</a>. Every dye added by this mod should be compatible with every mod that requests some sort of dye in their crafting recipes.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">As soon as you travel around your world, you'll either find a new type of flower, or in the case you're wandering through a desert, a new type of cactus. Look around for a while and you'll see that there is one type of flower and one type of cactus for each dye. You'll find them every few chunks in small groups sorted by their color. Flowers or cacti of the same color but with different hues spawn together in one group. Besides from looking pretty, they serve a useful purpose. Upon breaking one of either a flower or a cactus, they'll drop you two respective seeds, one plant petal and one plant part, each in their respective color.&nbsp;Harvesting them with a pair of shears will drop the flower or cactus plant, so you can plant or pot them around your home for decoration.<br /></span><br /><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-dropping-plants.gif" width="704" height="352" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">If you're lucky enough, you'll find a village with up to three custom fields for flowers and cacti each, packed with different color types. A farmer will offer you some trades to either get emeralds for flower and cactus seeds or to get plant petals or parts for emeralds. Of course there's a trade for each type of color for each item type.&nbsp;Plants parts can be used just like bone meal, to speed up the growth of your plants manually, or even use it as a fertilizer in conjunction with third party mods.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-trading-villager.gif" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">The seeds you just got are pretty straight forward to use, either loosen some dirt with a hoe for flower seeds to be plantable or plant cactus seeds on some sand. Give them some time to grow to their full size. You wont get more than one seed and not even a single plant petal or part if you harvest them before they've reached their final stage. You can tell that they've reached their final stage by their fully blooming blossom. Just as the natural spawning flowers and cacti, the farmable ones also drop two respective seeds, one plant petal and one plant part of their respective color each. Harvesting them with a pair of shears will drop the flower or cactus plant, so you can plant or pot them around your home for decoration.</span></span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-dropping-crops.gif" width="704" height="352" /></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">To finally get the dye, just place the petals in any type of furnace to dry them. The result will be some dye of the respective petal color. You can use this dye just as any regular dye, color some wool or glass, even sheeps.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br /></span></span></span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-smelting-plantpetal.gif" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can even store the dye in blocks, just in case you made too much of it, and they're decorative as well.</p>
<p><br /><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-crafting-dyeblock.gif" width="352" height="179" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And of course you can get your dye back out of those chunky blocks to keep coloring some sheeps.</p>
<p><br /><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-crafting-dye.gif" width="352" height="179" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">But you can go further than that, by combining any dye and clay in any crafting grid, you'll get dyed clay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-dyeing-clay.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">With the help of dyed clay, you'll be able to craft an unfired plantpot in any color, based on the dyed clay.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;" src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-crafting-plantpot.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">So far this plantpot is unusable, since it's still in it's raw form. To be able to use it, you need to bake it first.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-smelting-plantpot.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Depending on the plant you want to pot, you need to fill a fired plantpot with dirt for flowers or sand for cacti.<br /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-crafting-flowerpot.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Now you got yourself either a flowerpot or a cactuspot, a plantpot that you can actually place and plant a plant in.<br /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-crafting-cactuspot.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Just like with dyes, you can combine dyed clay to dyed clay blocks to save space or even to use them for decoration.<br /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-crafting-clayblock.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">And of course you can also revert that process to get back all of that dyed clay you've put into your dyed clay blocks.<br /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/V1.4.0-crafting-clay.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The provided config file will let you disable certain modules of the mod, you can decide how to obtain petals and seeds and which mod compatibility should get loaded.&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">You are allowed to use this mod in your modpack, as long as it is credited in some kind of modlist.</span></span></p>
