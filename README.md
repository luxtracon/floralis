<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Floralis aims to make any type of dye farmable in an automatable way with the help of third party mods. Furthermore the dye is compatible with pretty much every mod that requests any sort of dye in it's crafting recipes.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">Currently supported mods for automated farming are<br /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">As soon as you travel around your newly generated world, or newly generated chunks if you tend to add this mod to your existing world, you'll find a new type of flower, one for each color. You'll find them every few chunks, they usually spawn in small groups, sorted by their color. Flowers of the same color, but with different hues like light blue and blue, also spawn together in one group. Besides from looking pretty and decorative, they serve a useful purpose. As soon as you break one of those flowers, they'll drop you a seed and a petal in their respective color, sometimes even more than one.</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/drops.gif" alt="" width="352" height="352" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">If you're lucky enough, you'll even find a village with one to three custom fields, each packed with a different color type of flowers. Look around and you'll maybe find a villager that will offer you some trades to get emeralds from petals or seeds from emeralds.<br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/trade.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The seeds you just got are pretty straight forward to use, just loosen some dirt with a hoe and plant them just as regular seeds. Give them some time to let them grow to their full size, or just dump some bonemeal over them, so you can harvest them and get even more seeds and petals.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/cropdrops.gif" alt="" width="352" height="352" /><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">How do I get my dye now? Place the petals you just harvested into any furnace and let them dry, the result will be some dye. You can use this dye just as any regular dye, color some wool or glass. Even sheeps. The dye is also compatible with any crafting recipe from any mod that requests some sort of dye.</span></span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/drying.gif" alt="" width="352" height="179" /></span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">You can even store the dye in blocks, just in case you got too much of it, and they're decorative as well!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/block.gif" alt="" width="352" height="172" /></span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">And of course you can get your dye back out of those chunky blocks to keep coloring some sheeps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><img src="https://cdn.zekro.de/mods/floralis/media/dye.gif" alt="" width="352" height="172" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;">The provided config file will let you disable certain modules of the mod, you can decide how to obtain petals and seeds and which mod compatibility should get loaded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;"><br />Yes, you are allowed to use this mod in your modpack, just credit the mod in something like a modlist if you're going to make your pack public.<br /></span></p>
